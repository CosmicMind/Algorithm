## CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Algorithm's core features into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Algorithm', '~> 3.1.0'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds dependencies and provides binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```
To integrate Algorithm into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

```bash
github "CosmicMind/Algorithm"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Algorithm.framework` into your Xcode project.

## Changelog

Algorithm is a growing project and will encounter changes throughout its development. It is recommended that the [Changelog](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Algorithm/wiki/Changelog) is reviewed prior to updating versions.

## Probability

Each data structure within Algorithm is equipped with probability tools.

#### Basic Probability

For example, determining the probability of rolling a 3 using a die of 6 numbers.

```swift
let die = [Int](arrayLiteral: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

if 0.1 < die.probability(of: 3) 
		// Do something ...
}
```

#### Conditional Probability

For conditional probabilities that require a more complex calculation, use block statements.

```swift
let die = [Int](arrayLiteral: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

let pOfX = die.probability { (number) in
	return 5 < number || 0 == number % 3
}

if 0.33 < pOfX {
	// Do something ...
}
```

<a name="expectedvalue"></a>
## Expected Value

The expected value of rolling a 3 or 6 with 100 trials using a die of 6 numbers is:

```swift
let die = [Int](arrayLiteral: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

if 20 < die.expectedValue(trials: 100, for: 3, 6) {
		// Do something ...
}
```

<a name="doublylinkedlist"></a>
## DoublyLinkedList

The DoublyLinkedList data structure is excellent for large growing collections of data. Below is an example of its usage.

```swift
var listA = DoublyLinkedList<Int>()
        
listA.insert(atFront: 3)
listA.insert(atFront: 2)
listA.insert(atFront: 1)

var listB = DoublyLinkedList<Int>()

listB.insert(atBack: 4)
listB.insert(atBack: 5)
listB.insert(atBack: 6)

var listC = listA + listB

listC.cursorToFront()

var value = listC.cursor

while nil != value {
    // Do something ...
    
    value = listC.next()
}
```

<a name="stack"></a>
## Stack

The Stack data structure is a container of objects inserted and removed according to the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle. Below is an example of its usage.

```swift
var stack = Stack<Int>()

stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
stack.push(3)

while !stack.isEmpty {
	let value = stack.pop()
	
	// Do something ...
}
```

<a name="queue"></a>
## Queue

The Queue data structure is a container of objects inserted and removed according to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle. Below is an example of its usage.

```swift
var queue = Queue<Int>()

queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
queue.enqueue(3)

while !queue.isEmpty {
    let value = queue.dequeue()

    // Do something ...
}
```

<a name="deque"></a>
## Deque

The Deque data structure is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) and last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle. Essentially, a Deque is a Stack and Queue combined. Below are examples of its usage.

```swift
var dequeA = Deque<Int>()
dequeA.insert(atBack: 1)
dequeA.insert(atBack: 2)
dequeA.insert(atBack: 3)

while !dequeA.isEmpty {
	let value = dequeA.removeAtFront()
	
	// Do something ...
}

var dequeB = Deque<Int>()
dequeB.insert(atBack: 4)
dequeB.insert(atBack: 5)
dequeB.insert(atBack: 6)

while !dequeB.isEmpty {
	let value = dequeB.removeAtFront()
	
	// Do something ...
}
```

<a name="redblacktree"></a>
## RedBlackTree

A RedBlackTree is a Balanced Binary Search Tree that maintains insert, remove, update, and search operations in a complexity of O(logn). The following implementation of a RedBlackTree also includes an order-statistic which allows the data structure to be accessed using subscripts like an array or dictionary. RedBlackTrees may store unique keys or non-unique key values. Below is an example of its usage.

```swift
var ages = RedBlackTree<String, Int>(uniqueKeys: true)

ages.insert(value: 16, for: "Sarah")
ages.insert(value: 12, for: "Peter")
ages.insert(value: 23, for: "Alex")

let node = ages[1]

if "Peter" == node.key {
    // Do something ...
}
```

<a name="sortedset"></a>
## SortedSet

SortedSets are data structures for algorithms and analysis design. Elements within a SortedSet are unique. Insert, remove, and search operations have a complexity of O(logn). The following implementation of a SortedSet includes an order-statistic which allows the data structure to be accessed using an index subscript like an array. Below are examples of its usage.

```swift
let setA = SortedSet<Int>(elements: 1, 2, 3)
let setB = SortedSet<Int>(elements: 4, 3, 6)
let setC = SortedSet<Int>(elements: 7, 1, 2)
let setD = SortedSet<Int>(elements: 1, 7)
let setE = SortedSet<Int>(elements: 1, 6, 7)

// Union.
setA + setB
setA.union(setB)

// Intersection.
setC.intersection(setD)

// Subset.
setD < setC
setD.isSubset(of: setC)

// Superset.
setD > setC
setD.isSuperset(of: setC)

// Contains.
setE.contains(setA.first!)

// Probability.
setE.probability(of: setA.first!, setA.last!)
```

<a name="sortedmultiset"></a>
## SortedMultiSet

A SortedMultiSet is a SortedSet that allows non-unique elements. Look at [SortedSet](#sortedset) for examples of its usage.

<a name="sorteddictionary"></a>
## SortedDictionary

A SortedDictionary is a data structure that maintains a sorted set of keys with value pairs. Keys within a SortedDictionary are unique and insert, remove, update, and search operations have a complexity of O(logn).

<a name="sortedmultidictionary"></a>
## SortedMultiDictionary

A SortedMultiDictionary is a SortedDictionary that allows non-unique keys. Below is an example of its usage.

```swift
struct Student {
    var name: String
}

let sarah = Student(name: "Sarah")
let peter = Student(name: "Peter")
let alex = Student(name: "Alex")

var students = SortedMultiDictionary<String, Student>()

students.insert(value: sarah, for: sarah.name)
students.insert(value: peter, for: peter.name)
students.insert(value: alex, for: alex.name)

for student in students {
    // Do something ...
}
```
